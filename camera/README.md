MyCam
======

MyCam is a webcam on motors that follows you using face detection and can be wirelessly controlled using the Myo armband. Using the Myo, you can start and stop the video recording as well as take pictures at any point during the recording. And since MyCam is on a motorized platform, it can turn to keep you in the frame. When you have multiple people moving in the frame, MyCam still orients itself to keep everyone in the picture.


MyCam thus allows for a natural video recording without a dedicated cameraperson. Possible use cases for the MyCam include journalism, sports photography, lectures, and conference presentations.
