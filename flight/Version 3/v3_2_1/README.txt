NON WORKING FLIGHT CODE

Third attempt to add altitude functionality to Otto
Reverting back to meters for altitude units. Adding exponential smoothing
algorithm to smooth climb rate.

-Using a map function for throttle cannot work due to the the inability to get higher
 than a certain rotation speed
 
-Need to implement a different form. Possibly a 'rcthr += thrchange' 


##January 24, 2015
-Added timer to slow down throttle increase in an attempt to make the '+=' method
 usable. Untested.  
 
##January 26, 2015
-Software testing promising. Untested in flight. Do not fly.
