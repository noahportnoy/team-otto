Andrew’s Edits. to v3_1

Added function to switch into/out of altitude hold while in the air.
Changed alt feedback loop to only work on altitude, not climb rate
	-doesn’t seem to respond quickly enough to changes in alt.	
	-Probably a matter of correct tuning though.

*At good battery otto hovers at throttle of ~1320

Issue:
Drone oscillates and becomes unstable


WILL FLY UPON TURNING SAFTEY AND SWITCHING F.MODE INTO THE UPMOST POSITION! USE CAUTION WHEN RUNNING THIS CODE.
