Andrewâ€™s Edits. to v3_1

Made the MAP function use float as opposed to longs to achieve smoother altitude hold.
Edited gains in the altitude PID loop.
Set the desired gain to 0.5m.
Added software to check the battery monitor.

Multiple test done with this code & it is taking off but not as smooth as it needs to be.



WILL FLY UPON TURNING SAFTEY OFF! USE CAUTION WHEN RUNNING THIS CODE.
